Chibi utilizes modern terminal layouts, so a few configurations might be necessary to ensure everything functions as expected. In most cases, these prerequisites aren’t required, but if you encounter issues or improper output, follow this guide to set up everything correctly.

## Using Nerd Font

[Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) are regular monospace fonts enhanced with custom and layout-specific glyphs. You can download the **Nerd Font Patch** for your preferred monospace font from the [Nerd Fonts website](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads).

## Supported Terminals

Ensure your terminal supports the ANSI 24-bit color profile. Here are some terminals that work seamlessly:

- [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal)
- [Gnome Terminal](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-terminal)
- [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org/)
- [Kitty](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty), and others.

## AniList Account

Chibi integrates with [AniList](https://anilist.co) to sync your anime and manga progress. You can create a free AniList account [here](https://anilist.co/signup).

## Final Steps

If you’ve completed the prerequisites but Chibi still isn’t working, feel free to open an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/CosmicPredator/chibi-cli/issues/new/choose) for further assistance.
