## Ubuntu / Debian

For Ubuntu/Debian-based distros, you can install Chibi directly from the `.deb` package provided on the [Releases](https://github.com/CosmicPredator/chibi-cli/releases/latest) page. After downloading, you can either double-click on it to install via the software manager or use the following command in a terminal:

```shell
sudo dpkg -i chibi_1.0.0_amd64.deb
```

## Other Distros

For other distros, you can download the latest binary (`chibi_1.0.0_linux_amd64`) from the [Releases](https://github.com/CosmicPredator/chibi-cli/releases/latest). After downloading, open a terminal in the directory where you downloaded Chibi and follow these instructions,

1. Rename the binary to `chibi`,

   ```shell
   mv ./chibi_1.0.0_linux_amd64 ./chibi
   ```

2. Make the binary executable:

   ```shell
   chmod +x ./chibi
   ```

3. Move the binary to `/usr/local/bin` (requires sudo privileges):

   ```shell
   sudo mv ./chibi /usr/local/bin/chibi
   ```

4. Verify the installation by checking the version:

   ```shell
   chibi version
   # 1.0.0
   ```

::: warning
`1.0.0` in the name `chibi_1.0.0_linux_amd64` and `chibi_1.0.0_amd64.deb` refers to the version of Chibi you are downloading. In your case, the latest binary name will be different depending on the latest version of chibi.
